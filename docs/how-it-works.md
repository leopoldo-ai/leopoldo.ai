# How Leopoldo Works

Leopoldo is an expertise system for Claude. Not a prompt library. Not a collection of templates. A system: orchestrator, agents, quality gates, correction loop, and auto-evolution, all working together so Claude produces expert-level, structured outputs on real professional tasks.

## What makes it different

| Dimension | Prompt libraries | Leopoldo |
|-----------|-----------------|---------|
| Output type | Chat responses | Structured deliverables (reports, models, briefs) |
| Quality control | None | Blocking gates at every workflow phase |
| Error handling | Manual re-prompt | Automatic postmortem, root cause logged |
| Improvement over time | Degrades as models shift | Auto-evolution cycle, weekly |
| Vertical depth | Generic | Domain packs: finance, legal, consulting |
| Installation | Copy-paste | One command |

## What you get

Every installation includes the full system:

- **Orchestrator**: routes tasks to the right workflow agent
- **Agents**: Specialized workflow agents for multi-step processes. The open-source platform includes system-claw, reporting-output, and the evolution agent. Premium plugins add domain-specific agents (6 for finance, 4 for legal, 3 for consulting, 3 for competitive intelligence).
- **Quality gates**: phase gates, doc gates, security gates. Blocking, not advisory.
- **Correction loop**: every user correction triggers a postmortem before the fix
- **Imprint**: adaptive learning layer. Observes corrections, builds a calibration profile, applies preferences at session start. You never repeat yourself.
- **system-claw**: scans your MCP servers, CLI tools, and hooks on session start. Routing adapts to your actual environment.
- **Evolution cycle**: weekly automated improvement, user-approved before applied

## Installing

```bash
/leopoldo install [plugin-slug]
```

That's it. The system handles CLAUDE.md merge, conflict resolution, and manifest tracking automatically.
